## Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose (optional)
- Node.js 18+ (for local development)
- **No Database Server Required!** Uses SQLite (local file storage)

## Getting Started with Docker

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd Restaurant-Pos
   ```

2. Start the application:
   ```bash
   ./start.sh
   # Or manually:
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. **Create Public Link (Anyone Can Use!):**
   ```bash
   ./start-with-tunnel.sh
   # This starts the app AND creates a working public URL
   # ⚠️ Keep terminal open to keep link active!
   ```
   
   **If link stops working:** Run `./start-with-tunnel.sh` again to get a new active URL.

4. Access the application:
   - **Local**: http://localhost:80
   - **Network**: http://YOUR_IP:80
   - **Public URL**: (Generated by get-public-url.sh)
   - **Login**: admin@restaurant.com / admin123

## 🌐 Global Access & Port Forwarding

The application is configured for **worldwide access**:
- ✅ Server binds to all network interfaces (`0.0.0.0`)
- ✅ CORS allows all origins
- ✅ Ports exposed: 80 (frontend), 5001 (backend)
- ✅ Auto-detects API URL based on access method

### Quick Global Access Options:

**Option 1: ngrok (Easiest - 2 minutes)**
```bash
./ngrok-setup.sh
# Get instant public HTTPS URL
```

**Option 2: Cloudflare Tunnel (Free & Permanent)**
```bash
./cloudflare-tunnel.sh
# Get permanent free public URL
```

**Option 3: Router Port Forwarding**
- See `GLOBAL-ACCESS-SETUP.md` for complete guide
- Access via: `http://YOUR_PUBLIC_IP:80`

**See `GLOBAL-ACCESS-SETUP.md` for complete worldwide access guide.**

## Local Development

### 1. Backend (SQLite - Local Storage)

No database server needed! SQLite uses a local file:

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env   # then edit .env and set JWT_SECRET
npm install
npx prisma generate   # generate Prisma client for SQLite
npx prisma db push    # create SQLite database file and tables
npx prisma db seed    # create admin user + sample data (optional)
npm run dev
```

**Database File:** `backend/prisma/data.db` (created automatically)

**First-time login:** If you didn't run the seed, create the first admin with:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/auth/setup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Admin","email":"admin@restaurant.com","password":"admin123"}'
```

Then log in with **admin@restaurant.com** / **admin123** (or the email/password you used in the request above).

### 2. Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
